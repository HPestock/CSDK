# CSDK
CSDK (Chris' Software Development Kit) is a program that uses a VM (CSDKVM) and a compiler (CSDKC) to create a web development system that can be closed source without needing to set up a web server using Node.JS or similar applications. 

This project uses an open source software called p5.js (https://p5js.org/), which is in no way mine and is used in this project.
